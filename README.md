# Non-Parametric-Survival-Analysis-Kaplan-Meier-Estimator

This project conducts non-parametric survival analysis using the Kaplan Meier estimator, handling missing data and assessing normality before estimating survival probabilities and additional metrics.

This repository showcases a comprehensive non-parametric survival analysis utilizing the Kaplan Meier estimator. Initially, the dataset "Survival Drug Use Relapse" is loaded and preprocessed, handling missing values gracefully to ensure robustness in analysis. Statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk and Q-Q plots assess the data's normality, ensuring its suitability for further analysis. Subsequently, the Kaplan Meier estimator is applied to estimate survival probabilities over time, with the resulting survival curve graphically depicted for clarity. Additional metrics, including median survival time and survival probability at a specific time point, augment the analysis, providing deeper insights into survival dynamics. This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone seeking to understand and perform non-parametric survival analysis using Python.
